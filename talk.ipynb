    "## The BumpHunter algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "BumpHunter is a usefull algorithm used in HEP community that allows to look for a **excess** (or deficit) in a **data** distribution w.r.t. a **reference background**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It will compute the **local** and **global p-value** of the most significant **localized deviation** (bump) in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The global p-value is computed by **generating toys** from the reference and scaning them like real data.  \n",
    "The global p-value is then *the p-value of the local p-values*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why pyBumpHunter ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Public implementation based on pure python (numpy/scipy).  \n",
    "Doesn't depend on the ROOT software.  \n",
    "Recently integrated to Scikit-HEP.  \n",
    "Still under active development."
